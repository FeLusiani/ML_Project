We have tested 3 different models on the regression problem: Extreme Learning Machine,
SVM, MLP and KNN. Hyper-parameters grid search was made with 5-fold cross-validaion
on a development set (90% of data). The best performing model (KNN with K=15 and
distance weight function) was then trained on the entirety of the development set,
and tested against the unseen test set (10% of data).
